Gnudi§§3270.0 g hung_ricotta¤240.0 g egg¤16.0 g black_pepper¤21.0 g salt¤3.0 g rasped_nutmeg¤350.0 g parm¤165.0 g semolina§§Prep:\nHang ricotta the day/night before in a cone strainer lined with cheese cloth set over a cambro. Reserve the whey.\n\nMaking dough:\nWeigh out all ingredients. In a large bowl, add the ricotta and eggs, followed by all ingredients except the semolina. Adjust seasoning if needed, and then add semolina (eating raw semolina can give you foodborne illness).\nAdjust texture and tackyness of dough by adding up to 20g more semolina. Store in cambro in fridge until ready to roll.\n\nRolling:\nGet a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Using the purple-handle ice cream scoop, scoop balls of gnudi onto parchment-lined sheet tray. Once portioned, get shallow hotel pan and cover the bottom with ~1/2 to 1 inch of semolina. Roll gnudi into balls and set into semolina in rows of 5. Once filled, cover completely with semolina and let cure in the fridge for (ideally) 3 days.§§Pasta

Crumpets§§480.0 g whole_milk_(3.5%)¤480.0 g water¤480.0 g all-purpose_flour¤30.0 g yeast¤10.0 g salt¤10.0 g sugar¤5.0 g baking_soda§§In a medium sized pot, measure out the milk and water. Measure out the sugar and add to the milk/water. On an induction, bring up to 41 degrees C. Once up to temp, vigorously whisk in the weighed yeast, to prevent clumps. If clumps form, use a hand blender to get rid of them. Allow the yeast to bloom until frothy, ~10 minutes.\n\nWhile yeast is blooming, in a large bowl, weigh out the flour. Weigh out salt and baking soda separately and add to the flour.\n\nOnce yeast is nicely bloomed, add to the dry ingredients and whisk vigorously to break up any clumps of flour. Let the batter rise until almost doubled in size and the batter is nice and frothy/bubbly. While the batter is rising, get the crumpet set-up (2x small rondeau, 8x ring mold, 1oz ladle, offset spatula, optional tweezers, non-stick spray).\n\nOnce batter is just about bloomed, set the smaller rondeau on the induction, and let heat at 250 degrees F with ring molds inside. The other rondeau will act as a lid and a holder for the 1oz ladle.\n\nWhen batter is risen and pans are hot, spray down the ring molds with non-stick and add just under 1 full ladle's worth of batter to each ring mold, ensuring edge-to-edge coverage of the cooking surface within the ring mold. Place ladle in lid and lid on the pan. Allow to cook ~2-3 mins, or 30 seconds after you hear condensation start to hear water sizzling in the pan.\n\nRemove ring molds using tweezers and remove crumpets using offset. Crumpets should be under 1/4" thick and have little gas bubble pockets on the surface, while being lightly golden on the bottom. Any that are thicker than this, or are completely flat on the surface, discard.\n\nSet cooked crumpets on a wire rack in rows, allowing to cool. Once batter no longer produces satisfactory crumpets, discard and store crumpets in a 1/2 hotel pan lined with peach paper. Store crumpets in layers 3 x 4, separating each layer with peach paper.§§Pasta¤prep
